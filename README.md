# celeste-tunicate-cells

This repo is dedicated to a bioinformatics project for Spring 2023 FISH 546. My version of this project will involve the replication of some aspects of the following research paper [Campagna et al. 2016](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2598-1) which produced 3 RNAseq data files.

Briefly, colonial marine tunicates like *Botryllus schlosseri* are capable of both sexually reproducing through a single fertilized egg (embryogenesis) and through asexual reproduction where new generations are derived from somatic cells of the parental body (blastogenesis). In healthy *Botryllus schlosseri*, blastogenesis occurs as a weekly synchronized process. Transcriptomic data available from this project isolated RNA three distinct stages during the blastogenesis cycle of *Botryllus schlosseri* from the whole body.

Within the code folder will be several Rmarkdown files titled with the corresponding week of the spring quarter containing captions and code chunks with weekly updates on progress of this project.

The data folder will remain empty on GitHub since much of the files necessary to the workflow exceed the 100 MB limit. However, the code will be able to access the following data files.
