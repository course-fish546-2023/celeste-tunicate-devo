# celeste-tunicate-cells
This repo contains a code folder and a data folder. Within the code folder will be several Rmarkdown files titled with the corresponding week of the spring quarter (this however may change and may be broken down into workflow titles such as QAQC, data visualization, etc.), containing captions and code chunks with weekly update on progress of class project. The data folder will likely remain empty as much of the data I will be using will be to large to upload to GitHub. However, maintaining a data folder will allow for users to be able to reproduce code chunks and follow the same workflows that I will conduct.
