This is file 3 of 3.

## 1. Accessing reference genome
For this workflow, we will utilize the assembled genome of [*Botryllus schlosseri*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/00569) as a reference when quantifying the transcripts of our transcriptome samples.

This code chunk is 'curling' the zip of the *Botryllus schlosseri* genome assembly. 
```{r, engine= 'bash'}
cd /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/cvaldi/celeste-tunicate-devo/data
curl --insecure -O https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/444/245/GCA_000444245.1_356a-chromosome-assembly/GCA_000444245.1_356a-chromosome-assembly_genomic.fna.gz
```

To unzip assembly and make sure you are in the data directory. Copy and paste the following into your terminal.

```{r, engine= 'bash'}
gzip -d GCA_000444245.1_356a-chromosome-assembly_genomic.fna.gz
```


## 2. Locate sequence reads
You should have used file 1 to download the sequence reads in a large harddrive. For this project the path for our sequence read fastq files are in:

```{r, engine= 'bash'}
# /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/cvaldi/tunicate-fish546/raw
```

## 3. Build an index file
We will be aligning our sequence reads to the reference genome

The below command takes the path to the HISAT2 executable.
Then with -f option we specify that the input is a fasta file (which can come in the fasta, fna, or fa file extension format).

We then title and create an index which is stored into the output folder. If you don't have an output folder in your working directory already, add one before running the below code.

With HISAT2 you can create exons and splice sites tabs and build this information into the reference index. However, to do so you would need access to a GTF (Gene Transfer Format) file which is currently unavailable for *Botryllus schlosseri*. 

GTF files typically include information about gene structures, such as the locations of exons, introns, and other features, and are commonly used for genome annotation and RNAseq analysis. 

We can proceed with making an index using HISAT2 without information regarding exons and splice sites with the following code chunk.

```{r, engine= 'bash'}
/home/shared/hisat2-2.2.1/hisat2-build \
-f ../data/GCA_000444245.1_356a-chromosome-assembly_genomic.fna \
../output/GCA_000444245.1_356a-valid.index
```

## 3. Perform alignment
Here we will align paired-end RNAseq files against the index we created using the HISAT2 software.

Below is currently an example of only aligning one of my RNAseq files query: **SRR10352205*.*

It seems like at least in the code chunk I need to specify the absolute path in order for hisat2 to find my input files. 
```{r, engine= 'bash'}
/home/shared/hisat2-2.2.1/hisat2 \
-x /home/shared/8TB_HDD_02/cvaldi/celeste-tunicate-devo/output/GCA_000444245.1_356a-valid.index \
-1 /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/cvaldi/tunicate-fish546/raw/SRR10352205_1.fastq   \
-2 /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/cvaldi/tunicate-fish546/raw/SRR10352205_2.fastq \
-S ../output/SRR10352205.sam \
--threads 7 

```

```{r, engine = 'bash'}
/home/shared/samtools-1.12/samtools view \
-@ 7 \
-Su ../output/SRR10352205.sam \
| /home/shared/samtools-1.12/samtools sort - \
-@ 7 \
-0 SRR10352205.sorted.bam 
/home/shared/samtools-1.12/samtool index SRR10352205.sorted.bam
```
